Original by David Viner (converted from c128)

converted to P500 by vossi 05/2020

Necessary:
- P500 patched kernal by vossi
- P500 patched basic (sys command redirected to kernal)

state 5.6.2020:
- choose in source with p500 switch what you want to assemble
- kernal and loader are same for p500 and 600/700 version
- most vars are in zp from $90 to $db, monitor needs $e000-$efff
- kernal must be in all ram banks at $fe000 for j-command (jsr)
- no known bugs?

fix01 dv forgot to change original-adr $eaa8 fnlen $b7 -> $9d
fix02 change 4x fa in assembler to temp
fix03 jump to goto was 2 bytes too short - one extra pha in go command! 

Kernal:
fix01 changed ptr to same address in monitor
fix02 default p500 irq - changeable by basic poke, reset+nmi vector to monitor break
fix03 permanently changed primm to faster routine
